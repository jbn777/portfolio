<h1>Assignment 1: GitHub Pages & Website Creation</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
The objective of this assignment was to create a portfolio website using GitHub Pages, understand the basics of Git and GitHub, and document the learning process.
</p>

<h2>Creating GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>
I created a GitHub repository named angelsnelson.github.io and enabled GitHub Pages from the repository settings. This allowed the repository to be hosted as a static website.
</p>

<h2>Website Creation</h2>
<p>
Multiple HTML files were created to structure the website, including a home page, an about page, an assignment documentation page, and a final project page. A navigation menu was added to connect all pages.
</p>

<h2>Learning Git Basics</h2>
<p>
I learned basic Git operations such as creating repositories, adding files, committing changes, and pushing updates to GitHub. These commands help in version control and project tracking.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to host a website using GitHub Pages</li>
  <li>Basic HTML page structure</li>
  <li>Using GitHub for version control</li>
  <li>Importance of documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This assignment helped me understand how GitHub can be used both as a version control system and as a platform to host personal documentation websites.
